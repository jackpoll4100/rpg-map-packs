# Star Wars and Sci-fi Maps
## Various maps I've made for running my Star Wars and other sci-fi rpg campaigns. Maps made with Inkarnate except where stated otherwise.

### Techno-organic Altar
#### A creepy techno-organic altar, could be used by some kind of cyborg cultists, etc.

### Research Facility
#### A research facility inside of a volcano. Created to be a Kyber crystal research base for the Sith Empire in one of my Star Wars campaigns. Made with a combination of [Station Architect](https://store.steampowered.com/app/617360/Station_Architect/) and Inkarnate.

### Smuggler's Cave
#### The idea for this one was a smuggler who's mind was trapped inside a holocron by a Sith he double crossed. He's had his holocron connected up to a bunch of computers in his cave in the desert and the Holonet so that he can still run smuggling operations from his holocron system.

### Sewer
#### A general industrial city sewer battle map.

### Guard Station
#### One floor of a military installation underground, containing a surveillance room, store room, and mess hall.

### Sith Lab
#### A Sith Lord's secret lab, where they were experimenting with various things like holocrons and transferring life force from one subject to another.

### Space Battle Aftermath
#### A space combat map set in the wreckage left behind in a previous space battle.

### Zillo Beast Arena
#### A battle inside a combat arena against a chained up Zillo beast that is missing an arm. Made with Inkarnate but the Zillo beast is a custom asset I sketched in [Krita](https://krita.org/en/).
