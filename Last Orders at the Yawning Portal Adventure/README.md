# Maps for the Last Orders at the Yawning Portal D&D Adventure
## I made these maps as the adventure didn't come with its own. All locations for the entire adventure are covered here as either part of the overall tavern map or one of the submaps. All maps made with [Inkarnate](https://inkarnate.com/).

### Growling Groghouse
#### The core map for the adventure, containing every point of interest and encounter mentioned in the adventure (the Feywild bar with it's portal, the private bowling alley, the owner's quarters, the Kenku's stage, etc. etc.). A handful of locations require separate battle maps which are listed below.

### Growling Groghouse Fighting Pit
#### A battle map for the bottom of the Groghouse's fighting pit in case the player's decide to fight in the arena.

### Growling Groghouse Ale Vat
#### The giant ale vat where the players fight the Ale Kracken so that they can unclog the ale taps. entrance is a trapdoor behind the bar on the first map.

### Skallindrax Fight
#### A map of the swamp plane the party is teleported to for the final boss fight with the dragon Skallindrax at the end of the adventure.
