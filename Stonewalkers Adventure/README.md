# Maps for the Stonewalkers Cosmere RPG Adventure
A set of maps I've made while running the Stonewalkers campaign. Specifically, I made maps for all the encounters that could result in combat but which did not have maps in the book. (I've also included a few different book easter eggs in these, like a Santhid under the water in the Everstorm map, etc. One of these is a sleepless horde in one of the maps if you can spot it.)

All maps were made in [Inkarnate](https://inkarnate.com/) and all maps have both a grid and non grid version. I've organized them by chapter below.

## Chapter 2

### Chasm
Map for the chasm battle with Calinai and the other singers. Made with Inkarnate, although the dead chasmfiend is a custom asset I sketched in [Krita](https://krita.org/en/).

### Ryvlk's Menagerie
The Menagerie where the players will fight the escaped whitespines. It's got the colorful chickens, skyeels, axehounds, purelake fish, etc.

### Red Rockbud
Map for the Red Rockbud gambling den. Can be used for setting the scene and also if the players fail the "Playing the Game" endeavor, then it can be the setting for their fight with Lirdan.

### Outer Market
A section of the outskirts of the Outer Market where the players first encounter and fight the Sons of Honor.

## Chapter 3

### Rathalas Cliff Face
Map for the precarious Rathalas walkways in the event that the "Bandit Ambush" is triggered, with an elevated platform on one side for the archers to use.

### Rathalas Maze of Bridges
Map for the possible fight with a pack of axehounds that occurs if the party fails the "Crossing the Maze of Bridges" endeavor.

## Chapter 4

### Everstorm Ship Battle
Map for battle against the enraged skyeels in the Everstorm. I built this map as 4 separate versions for each of the 4 damage stages of the ship described in the chapter. You can stack these in the VTT of your choice so that you can then switch them out as needed for dynamic damage to the ship as the combat goes on.

## Chapter 6

### Rall Elorim Streets
Map for any battle that might break out in the Rall Elorim streets (specifically fighting to free Axies in the "Collecting Shadows" event is likely).
