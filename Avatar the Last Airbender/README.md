# Avatar the Last Airbender RPG Maps
## Maps made for an Avatar rpg one shot I ran.

### Wei Shen Village
#### A village that has been plagued by spirit attacks. This is due to overfarming and taking more of the natural lands than they should, which is in turn caused by pressure be exacted on them by Daofei bandits to pay protection and give them large amounts of crops in exchange for their lives. The town well also contains a rift that few know about which connects to the spirit world.

### Wei Shen Village Spirit Attack
#### The village in the midst of an attack by angry spirits who come from (and later retreat back to) the rift in the well.

### Wei Shen Spirit World
#### The other side of the Spirit World rift in the village well, which lets out in a whirlpool in the northeast corner of the map. Here there is a dragon spirit (the spirit of slain dragon that crossed over into the Spirit World) who can possibly be reasoned with to stop the spirit attacks.
