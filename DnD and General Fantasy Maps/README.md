# DnD and General Fantasy Maps
One off maps made while running my homebrew Dnd campaigns etc. Maps made with [Inkarnate](https://inkarnate.com/) unless otherwise noted.

### Colony Zero
This and the Northen Wastes Region map were the first maps I made with Inkarnate and so are necessarily a little rougher. Colony Zero was a homebrew town for my DnD campaign, a far northern mining town jokingly given the name "Colony Zero" by the locals b/c it is always below zero degrees.

### Northern Wastes
The map of the larger homebrew region around Colony Zero (see note above).

### Mad Man's Keep Floor 1
First floor of a dungeon I made. Too many rooms to list them all, but the rooms with green liquid in them all feature some kind of acid or oozes, and the center area is a Minotaur's Maze with a Minotaur guarding it. Made with [RPG Map Editor 2](https://deepnight.itch.io/tabletop-rpg-map-editor).

### Mad Man's Keep Floor 2
Second floor of a dungeon I made. Again can't list all the rooms and items etc., but the purple liquid in a few rooms is a sort of "portal" where stepping into it teleports you to a linked room. Rooms R3 and R5 are linked, and room R7 is linked to the hidden room R8 with the exit staircase. One of the puzzles for unlocking the final door to that room was to notice that the layout of this floor was in the shape of the number 4 and draw that number on the door in blood. Made with [RPG Map Editor 2](https://deepnight.itch.io/tabletop-rpg-map-editor).

### Skull Island
A skull shaped island with a pirate's treasure buried on it.

### The Far Realm
Map of a region of the twisted Far Realm, with all sorts of weird buildings, many eyed monsters, and land that curves in on itself in unnatural ways.

### Cultist Encampment
A cultist encampment at the mouth of mountain tunnel where an evil ritual has recently been performed.

### Painting Puzzle
A room made for a puzzle to do with paintings on the wall (with the right hand side showing "zoomed in" views of the paintings on the wall).
