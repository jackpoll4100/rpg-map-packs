# Maps for the Cairn of the Winter King D&D Adventure
Maps I made for running the first chapter of the Cairn of the Winter King D&D adventure (the rest of the adventure takes place in a dungeon with good maps provided). All maps made in [Inkarnate](https://inkarnate.com/) .

### Fallcrest Docks
A mostly 1 to 1 redesign of the map shown in chapter 1 for the Fallcrest docks fight. I recreated it in Inkarnate because the book does not provide a "clean" version without GM notes on it.

### Cairn of the Winter King
Map of the exterior of the Cairn as the player's ship arrives. Mostly just used this for visuals of the frozen bone cairn as its unlikely to have a combat here.
